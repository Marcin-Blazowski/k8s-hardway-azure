# Prerequisites

## Some experience
Nice to have: Some hands-on experience with Azure, Azure networking and azure deployment templates (ARM).
If you do not have you can get some while moving through this tutorial.

## Azure Cloud Requirements

- Active Azure subscription. You can use a free one but default sizes of VMs were not availble for me while testing.
- 5 VMs, 5 public IP addresses, virtual network, storage account, file share will be created by default.
- If you use default sizes of VMs the cost should be lower then 2 EUR for 24 hours (or 0.7 EUR if you stop your testing after business hours).
- The chart below shows the cost estimation after several days of testing (about 1-2 hours per day of active resources).
